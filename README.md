# How to use

This project contains all of the needed dependencies and isolates each part of each day to it's own little section in the format of dX/ptY.

There are some helper scripts to quickly execute redundant tasks that are common for each day:

### New Day

`. ./newDay.sh dX`

- Executed from the root of the project (AdventOfCode_2021). Replace X with day

### Next Part

`. ./nextPart.sh`

- Execute from dX/pt1:

### Finish Day

`. ./finishDay.sh`

- Execute from dX/pt2:
